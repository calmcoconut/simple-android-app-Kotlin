# simple-android-app-Kotlin
Using Kotlin to make a simple android app simulating an online order app


For people trying to learn to make an android application.

1. Download an IDE. I recommend Android Studio. Follow their setup procedures (You will also need Java developer kit installed)
   https://developer.android.com/studio

2. Make a pull request. If you are new to github I recommend Github Desktop https://desktop.github.com/

3. Open this project using android studio.

4. To make your own version of this app, I highly recommend Google's Udacity course... Keep in mind they use Java not Kotlin for their project.
